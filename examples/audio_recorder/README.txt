Build and install
--------------------------

Type 'make' to build SDK.
Install 'nuttx.spk' to system.

After that, you can see worker binary 'MP3ENC', 'SRC'
in directory sdk/modules/audio/dsp.
Store worker binary in the path specified by option.
 - Default path
    worker binary : /mnt/sd0/BIN

Recording data is written to the optional path.
 - Default path
    contents      : /mnt/sd0/REC


NOTE

  Build preprocess DSP and deploy
  --------------------------
  
  If you would like to use preprocess DSP.
  Set config "EXAMPLES_AUDIO_RECORDER_USEPREPROC" = "y" before do make.

  When EXAMPLES_AUDIO_RECORDER_USEPREPROC is set and build this example,
  DSP binary for preprocess will out at "worker/src/PREPROC".
  Please place PREPROC binary file to SD card(/mnt/sd0/BIN).

  The codes of DSP is placed on "worker/userproc/src(or include)".
  You can edit them and it will be built with framework code in sdk(*)
  and embedded to DSP binary.
  (*)The framework codes are at "sdk/module/audio/components/usercustom/dsp_framework".
